public class RangeSumQuery{
    /*
        Approach
        Use a segment tree data structure
         Segment Tree used to solve numerous range query problems like finding minimum, maximum, sum, 
         greatest common divisor, least common denominator in array in logarithmic time.

         Property of Segment Trees:
         1. Root has n nodes
         2. All intermediate nodes have n-1 nodes
         3. So the total number of nodes is 2n-1
         3. The left child of a node at index i is stored at index 2i
         4. The right child of a node at index i is stored at index 2i + 1
